This is a small project to understand how contextAPI and useReducer Hook work. Practice forwarding state to sub-components and understand their way of mutating state from one point by one function. 
Reducers let you consolidate a componentâ€™s state update logic. Context lets you pass information deep down to other components without prop drilling.
